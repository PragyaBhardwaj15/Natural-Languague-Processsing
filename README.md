# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language.
It uses computational linguistics (ruled-based modelling of natural language) with machine learning, statistical, and deep learning models to analyze natural language and understand the actual meaning of text or voice data. It even understands the speaker’s or writer’s sentiment and intent.
It isn’t a new sciece, but has been advancing at a fast pace due to the availability of big data, increasingly effective algorithms, and the heightened interest in human-to-machine interaction and communication. NLP programming combines the fields of linguistics and computer science to decipher language structure and guidelines to comprehend, break down, and separate significant details from text and speech. It automates the translation process between computers and humans by manipulating unstructured data (words) in the context of a specific task (conversation). 

Natural language processing aims to enhance the way computers understand human text and speech and translate languages with logic-based learning. As computers can only understand and decipher programs and follow instructions, NLP works around making the process of understanding and reading languages much more efficient. 

NLP uses artificial intelligence and machine learning, along with computational linguistics to process text and voice data, derive meaning, figure out intent and sentiment, and form a response or input. Computers cannot understand or interpret text and words the way humans do, as they communicate in 1s and 0s. Hence, NLP enables computers to understand, emulate and respond intelligently to humans.

# Aim
The goal of natural language processing is to specify a language comprehension and production theory to such a level of detail that a person is able to write a computer program which can understand and produce natural language. The basic goal of NLP is to accomplish human like language processing.
